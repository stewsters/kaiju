## Kotlin Artificial Intelligence Java Utilities

Hows that for a backronym?

This is some utilities I extracted from some simple kotlin roguelikes I was working on.  The syntax works a bit better
 than regular Java for algorithm heavy stuff like this.  
 
In here is some things like pathfinding, serializing, and some matrix and vector stuff.

## How to use this in your project

Add Jitpack and the repo to your build.gradle or pom file.
